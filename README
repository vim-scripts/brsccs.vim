        In the sccs browser you see the text annotated by the version numbers.
        Each line has the version number when it has changed the last time.
        Press enter in any such line and you jump right to that version.
        Press ,< and you jump right "under" that version. I.e. right before
        that line was changed.

        ,+ or ,=        go forward one version
        ,<              go one version earlier than the annotation specifies
